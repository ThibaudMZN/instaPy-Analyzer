# instaPy Supervisor

instaPy Supervisor allows you to get and plot all the data coming from an instaPy Bot.

Original repo for this bot can be found at : https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy


## TODOs

* Better data management when parsing
* Sorting data by date (create a Date() object ?)
* Specifying default instaPy folders
* Load file directly from logs folder in computer
* General log visualisation with filters (likes, commented, session timeline)
